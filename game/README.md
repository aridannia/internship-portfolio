As part of an elective subject project on mental health, I participated in organizing an exhibition program where we were required to create a physical or online interactive activity for visitors.
Focusing on the topic of stress, I developed a fun Flappy Bird-style game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
To encourage engagement, participants who successfully achieved a score of 10 or more received a small gift from my booth.
