3) For my Database Management System project, I developed a web-based beauty service system using PHP, MySQL (phpMyAdmin), XAMPP, HTML, and CSS. The system allows customers to view appointment reminders, schedule new appointments, and receive updates. It also includes an admin interface that enables administrators to manage bookings and interact with users, ensuring smooth and efficient appointment handling.
